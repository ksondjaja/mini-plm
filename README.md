# mini-plm

## This a web Product Lifecycle Management application, to help apparel manufacturers keep track of detailed information of their products.


### Description

This application helps manufacturers store, edit, and view apparel product specifications through a user-friendly online database. Upon completion, the minimum viable product will focus mainly on keeping track of changes in product measurements, bill of material, and sewing instructions from prototype stage through production.
